# A Webpage Made With React & Bootstrap.

A project to demonstrate my React development skills. Using React & Bootstrap a website was developed in accordance with the task to have a menu that connects to a home, shop, interest, profile, & legal page.

In terms of functionality it is fairly simple, there are links at the top of the screen that allow movement between the pages which are fully responsive so can be seen on any device. It also includes an alterable login button with the user profile changing the text depending on whether it is the first time the user has logged out & a fully functional interest calculator.

## How To Install

This app was created using:
- [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction)
- [React Router DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)

To install:
1. Download the files to a local directory. 
2. Use a command/terminal to select the directory folder.
3. Run the following command 'npm install' to download the required modules.
4. Then once the modules have been downloaded enter the command 'npm start' to compile and run.
5. In the event that the app doesn't start in the browser enter the following address: 'localhost:3000'
